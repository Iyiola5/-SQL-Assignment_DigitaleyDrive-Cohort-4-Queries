# -SQL-Assignment_DigitaleyDrive-Cohort-4-Queries
This is an assignment given at the end of the SQL classes done during the Data Analysis class organized by DigitaleyDrive NG
The datasets used are that of Sales and Customer data which queries were requested to spool out some informations from the dataset but, the beautiful part is that i successfully did the assignment without consulting Google nor AI for help. So proud of myself
